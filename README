the window manager. nih stands for nihilist (not the existential nor moral)
[artistic]


Requirements

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (nihwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install nihwm (if
necessary as root):

    sudo make clean install
		or
	./sim


Running nihwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start nihwm using startx:

    exec nihwm

In order to connect nihwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec nihwm

(This will start nihwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec nihwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of nihwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
